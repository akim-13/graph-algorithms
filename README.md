# Prim's algorithm
This algorithm is used to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a weighted undirected graph. More information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm).

# Kruskal's algorithm
Similar to Prim's but connects the shortest edges into separate trees and then these trees are connected into an MST. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm).
